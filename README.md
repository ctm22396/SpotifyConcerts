# SpotifyConcerts

This is a python application that combines information from Spotify playlists with Songkick's database of concerts. The program generates a list of artists from a given playlist, finds bands that are similar to them, and outputs links and images for concerts coming to your town.

Install the dependencies (PIL, pandas, numpy, spotify) and just run ```python playlist_concert_gui.py``` in this directory.
